# Communicating Research Beyond Academia
<!--**A Relevant Research Series workshop prepared by [Mihaela Gruia](https://www.stm-assoc.org/people/mihaela-gruia/), Founder and Director of [Research Retold](https://www.researchretold.com/).**-->

Mihaela Gruia, Director of Research Retold, delivers a two-part workshop series on knowledge mobilization. In order to make an impact with your research, it is important to know how to share research findings with broader, non-academic audiences. Gruia explains how to create a communications plan that will aid researchers in translating long, complex research reports into documents that spark conservation.

By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to: 

1. Explain the importance of knowledge mobilization

2. Apply knowledge mobilization concepts to individual contexts

3. Describe the key components of a communications plan

4. Develop a personalized communications plan

Proceed to the first [session](session-1) to get started.
